What is Cypress?
  Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool build for modern web applications.
  Cypress uses JavaScript to write automated tests.
  Cypress addresses the Key pain points from other automation tools.
  Cypress is built on Node,js and comes packed as an npm module .
  As it built node.js,it uses javascript for writing tests.But 90% of coding can be done using  Cypress inbuilt commands which are easy to understand.
  Cypress makes our test simple when compared with other tools
  Cypress is having different architecture when you compare it with selenium.
  We can write faster,easier and more reliable tests using Cypress.

Cypress Ecosystem:
It is open Source and consists of
  1.Test Runner(Open source component,Locally Installed) helps us set up  and start writing test cases.
  2.Dashboard Service(Recording tests)
       The Dashboard provides you insight into what happened when your test ran.

Install the cypress TestRunner and write tests locally
    1.Set up tests
    2.Write tests 
Build a set up of suite of CI tests,record them and gain powerful insights.
    1.Run tests
    2.Record tests
